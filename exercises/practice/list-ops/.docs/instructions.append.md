# Hints

The `fold-left` and `fold-right` methods are "fold" functions, which is a concept from the functional programming world. See the Wikipedia page on folding for [general background](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fold_(higher-order_function)) and [signature/implementation hints](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fold_(higher-order_function)#Linear_folds).

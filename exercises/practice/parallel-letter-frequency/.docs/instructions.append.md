## Using Parallelism

The goal of this exercise is to practice parallelism with Emacs Lisp.

In Emacs Lisp this can be achieved by using [`asynchronous processes`](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/elisp/Asynchronous-Processes.html#:~:text=An%20asynchronous%20process%20is%20controlled,%2Dtype%20(see%20below)).

You may also want to look at the documentation for [`batch mode`](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/elisp/Batch-Mode.html), [`sentinels`](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/elisp/Sentinels.html) and [`receiving output from processes`](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/elisp/Output-from-Processes.html).

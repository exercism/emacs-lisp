# Instructions Append

In addition to the function, _numbers_, that cleans up phone numbers, you need to write two more functions, _area-code_ and _pprint_ in the Emacs Lisp track. 

Each of the extra functions takes the phone number as its only parameter.

The first function _area-code_ extracts the area code from the input, while the second function _pprint_ transforms the input to a string in the format of 
```
(NXX) NXX-XXXX
```
where `N` and `X` are as described above.

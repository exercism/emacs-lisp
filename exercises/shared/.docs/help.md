# Help

To get help if you're having trouble, you can use one of the following resources:

- [The Emacs Wiki](http://emacswiki.org/) is invaluable. Spend lots of time here.
- [The Emacs Editor](http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/index.html) is the official manual for GNU Emacs.
- IRC - there are [freenode](https://freenode.net/) channels for `#emacs`, `#prelude`, and many Emacs
  packages, and many helpful folks around. And with emacs, IRC is as close as
  `M-x erc`.
- [StackOverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/elisp) can be used to search for your problem and see if it has been answered already. You can also ask and answer questions.

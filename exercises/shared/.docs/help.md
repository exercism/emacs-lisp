# Help

To get help if you're having trouble, you can use one of the following resources:

- [The Emacs Wiki](http://emacswiki.org/) is invaluable. Spend lots of time here.
- [The Emacs Editor](http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/index.html) is the official manual for GNU Emacs.
- IRC - there are [Libera.Chat](https://libera.chat/) channels for `#emacs`, `#org-mode`, and many Emacs
  packages, and many helpful folks around. And with emacs, IRC is as close as
  `M-x erc`.
- Matrix - on [Matrix](https://matrix.org/) there are rooms for [emacs](https://matrix.to/#/#emacs:matrix.org), [org-mode](https://matrix.to/#/#org-mode:matrix.org), and other Emacs packages.
  You can [join the Emacs Matrix space](https://matrix.to/#/#emacs-space:matrix.org) to get an overview of the available channels.
  To join Matrix from within Emacs you can use the [Ement.el](https://github.com/alphapapa/ement.el) package.
- [StackOverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/elisp) and [Emacs StackExchange](https://emacs.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/elisp) can be used to search for your problem and see if it has been answered already. You can also ask and answer questions.

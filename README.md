**`exercism/emacs-lisp`** is one of many programming language tracks you can study on [exercism.org][exercism-website].
This repo holds all the instructions, tests, code, & support files for Emacs Lisp _exercises_ currently under development or implemented & available for students.
If you haven't already, you can check out and study the live language track [here][exercism-emacs-lisp-track].

ðŸŒŸ &nbsp;&nbsp;The test runner is currently running Emacs 29.3

Currently the Emacs Lisp track doesn't feature a syllabus, so it only contains practice exercises. Practice exercises are open-ended problems that allow you to build and test your knowledge of a programming language. You can find the practice exercises referenced in the [config.json][config-json] and the files in the [`exercises/practice`][emacs-lisp-exercises-practice-dir] directory. The practice exercises are shared between tracks. You can find the canonical problem description in the [problem specifications repository][problem-specifications-repository].

The following guide is intended to give you an overview about the different ways to help and to point you to the relevant documentation.

<br>
There are several ways of contributing to the Emacs Lisp track. Examples would be

- [reporting][emacs-lisp-new-issue] problems with the track or possible improvements
- working on [practice exercises][practice-exercises]
- working on track [tooling][emacs-lisp-tooling] and [CI][emacs-lisp-ci]
- working on the [test runner][emacs-lisp-test-runner]
- working on track documents
- contributing [approaches][exercism-approaches]
- contributing [articles][exercism-articles]

Feel free to open an issue or open a pull request for any of those items.
Pull Requests should be focused on a single change.
They must pass the CI system and need a review by a maintainer before they can get merged.

You can also start work on

- a [syllabus][exercism-syllabus] / [concept exercises][exercism-concept-exercises-stories], used to teach a language step by step
- an [analyzer][exercism-analyzers], used to give automated feedback on student solutions
- a [representer][exercism-representers], used to give automated feedback on sutdent solutions

If you want to start work on one of those items please first get in touch via [GitHub issues][emacs-lisp-github-issues] or the [discourse forum][discourse-forum-emacs-lisp].
